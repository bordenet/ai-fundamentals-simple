### üß† How Inference Works in LLMs (like GPT)

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Encoding**  
   The input text (e.g., a prompt or question) is tokenized ‚Äî converted into numerical representations called **tokens**.

2. **Model Forward Pass**  
   These tokens are passed through the model‚Äôs layers:
   - **Embedding Layer**: Converts tokens into dense vectors.
   - **Transformer Blocks**: Apply attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks to process context and relationships.
   - **Output Layer**: Produces a probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next token.

3. **Decoding**  
   The model selects the most likely next token (or samples from the distribution), appends it to the input, and repeats the process ‚Äî generating text one token at a time.

4. **Stopping Criteria**  
   Generation continues until a stop token is reached, a max length is hit, or another rule is triggered.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Inference vs. Training

| Aspect        | Training                          | Inference                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Purpose       | Learn patterns from data          | Use learned patterns to predict   |
| Data          | Labeled datasets                  | Unseen input                      |
| Compute Cost  | Very high (GPU clusters)          | Lower (can run on CPUs or edge)   |
| Time          | Hours to weeks                    | Milliseconds to seconds           |

### üß™ Example: Inference in a Chatbot

**Input**: "What's the capital of France?"  
**Model Output**: "Paris"

The model didn‚Äôt learn this answer during inference ‚Äî it **recalls** it from training and **computes** the most likely response based on context.
