# Enterprise AI Integration - Instructor Guide

## Session Overview
This guide focuses on integrating AI systems into enterprise environments, covering security, scalability, and best practices.

## Prerequisites
- Completed previous sessions
- Understanding of enterprise architecture
- Basic knowledge of cloud services
- Security fundamentals

## Learning Path

### 1. Enterprise Architecture (1 hour)

#### Key Concepts
- System design principles
- Security considerations
- Compliance requirements
- Cost management

#### Architecture Components
1. API Gateway
2. Authentication/Authorization
3. Model Serving
4. Monitoring & Logging

### 2. Implementation (2 hours)

#### Core Systems
1. Authentication Service
```python
# Code samples will be in the notebook
# We'll implement:
# 1. OAuth integration
# 2. Role-based access
# 3. Token management
```

2. Model Serving Platform
```python
# Including:
# 1. Load balancing
# 2. Auto-scaling
# 3. Request routing
```

3. Monitoring System
```python
# Covering:
# 1. Metrics collection
# 2. Alert configuration
# 3. Dashboard setup
```

#### Common Challenges & Solutions
- Authentication issues
- Scaling problems
- Performance bottlenecks
- Cost optimization

### 3. Security Implementation (1.5 hours)

#### Key Areas
1. Data encryption
2. Access control
3. Audit logging
4. Compliance monitoring
