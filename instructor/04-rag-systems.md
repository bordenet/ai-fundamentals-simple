# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems - Instructor Guide

## Session Overview
This guide walks through implementing a RAG system from scratch, focusing on practical applications and real-world use cases.

## Prerequisites
- Completed previous sessions
- Basic understanding of vector embeddings
- Familiarity with vector databases
- Python programming experience

## Learning Path

### 1. RAG Fundamentals (1 hour)
Work through `notebooks/rag/retrieval_augmented_generation.ipynb`

#### Key Concepts
- Vector embeddings
- Similarity search
- Document chunking
- Context integration

### 2. Building RAG Components (2 hours)

#### Core Components Implementation
1. Document Processor
```python
# Code samples will be in the notebook
# We'll implement:
# 1. Document chunking
# 2. Text cleaning
# 3. Metadata extraction
```

2. Vector Store Integration
```python
# We'll cover:
# 1. Vector DB setup
# 2. Indexing
# 3. Similarity search
```

3. Context Integration
```python
# Including:
# 1. Query processing
# 2. Context assembly
# 3. Response generation
```

#### Common Challenges & Solutions
- Document preprocessing issues
- Vector store performance
- Query relevance problems
- Context length management

### 3. Advanced Features (1.5 hours)

#### Implementation Topics
1. Hybrid search methods
2. Re-ranking strategies
3. Metadata filtering
4. Caching mechanisms

#### Practical Exercise
Build an enterprise documentation system with:
- Document ingestion pipeline
- Smart search functionality
- Context-aware responses
- Performance monitoring

### 4. Enterprise Integration (1 hour)

#### Topics
1. Scaling considerations
2. Security implementation
3. Monitoring setup
4. Performance optimization
