> Regarding LLM/Transformers, explain Full vs. Sparse attention?

### 🧠 **Full Attention**

This is the original attention mechanism introduced in the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017).

- **How it works**: Every token attends to **every other token** in the input sequence.
- **Complexity**: $$O(n^2)$$ — quadratic in the sequence length.
- **Pros**:
  - Captures **global context** very well.
  - Ideal for **short sequences** or tasks requiring deep inter-token relationships.
- **Cons**:
  - Becomes **computationally expensive** and memory-intensive for long sequences.
  - Limits scalability for tasks like document-level understanding or long-form generation.

### 🌌 **Sparse Attention**

Sparse attention reduces the number of token-to-token interactions by **limiting which tokens attend to which others**.

- **How it works**: Each token attends to a **subset** of other tokens — based on patterns like:
  - **Local windows** (nearby tokens)
  - **Strided patterns** (every k-th token)
  - **Global tokens** (special tokens attend to all)
- **Complexity**: Often $$O(n \log n)$$ or even $$O(n)$$ depending on the sparsity pattern.
- **Pros**:
  - Much more **efficient** for long sequences.
  - Enables models like **Longformer**, **BigBird**, and **Sparse Transformer** to handle inputs with thousands of tokens.
- **Cons**:
  - May **miss global dependencies** unless carefully designed.
  - Requires **engineering trade-offs** to balance sparsity and expressiveness.

### ⚖️ Summary Comparison

| Feature              | Full Attention         | Sparse Attention        |
|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Token Interactions   | All-to-all             | Subset (pattern-based)   |
| Computational Cost   | High ($$O(n^2)$$)      | Lower ($$O(n \log n)$$ or $$O(n)$$) |
| Context Capture      | Global                 | Local + selective global |
| Scalability          | Poor for long inputs   | Excellent for long inputs |
| Use Cases            | GPT, BERT              | Longformer, BigBird, etc. |

WHere’s a simple **ASCII art** representation of **Full vs. Sparse Attention** in LLMs:

---

### 🔵 Full Attention (All-to-All)

```
Input Tokens:  T1  T2  T3  T4

Attention Map:
       T1  T2  T3  T4
    +----------------
T1 |  ●   ●   ●   ●
T2 |  ●   ●   ●   ●
T3 |  ●   ●   ●   ●
T4 |  ●   ●   ●   ●
```

Each token attends to **every other token**, forming a dense matrix.

---

### 🟢 Sparse Attention (Selective)

```
Input Tokens:  T1  T2  T3  T4

Attention Map:
       T1  T2  T3  T4
    +----------------
T1 |  ●   ○   ○   ●
T2 |  ●   ●   ○   ○
T3 |  ○   ●   ●   ○
T4 |  ●   ○   ●   ●
```

- ● = attends to
- ○ = does not attend

Tokens attend to **local neighbors**, **global tokens**, or follow a **pattern** — reducing computation.
