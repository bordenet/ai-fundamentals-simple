## Conceptual Framework

### 1. MCP Fundamentals

#### What is the Model Context Protocol?
**Definition**: A standardized protocol for managing context and state in AI applications, enabling consistent communication between AI models and external systems.

**Core Principles**:
- **Standardization**: Common interface for context management across different AI systems
- **Interoperability**: Enables seamless integration between diverse AI tools and platforms
- **State Management**: Consistent handling of context, memory, and conversation state
- **Extensibility**: Flexible architecture supporting custom tools and integrations

#### Key Concepts
**Context Management in LLMs**
- **Challenge**: Managing conversation history and relevant information across interactions
- **Solution**: Structured context preservation and retrieval mechanisms
- **Benefits**: Improved consistency, better user experience, enhanced reasoning capability

**Protocol Design Principles**
- **Modularity**: Clear separation between different system components
- **Versioning**: Support for protocol evolution and backward compatibility
- **Security**: Built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms
- **Performance**: Optimized for low-latency, high-throughput operations

**State Persistence Patterns**
- **Session State**: Temporary context for individual conversations
- **User State**: Persistent information across multiple sessions
- **System State**: Configuration and operational parameters
- **Shared State**: Information accessible across multiple agents or users

### 2. MCP Architecture Overview

#### Core Components
**Context Manager**
- **Responsibility**: Central coordination of context and state
- **Functions**: Context storage, retrieval, update, and cleanup
- **Design Patterns**: Repository pattern, event sourcing, CQRS
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling through partitioning and caching
