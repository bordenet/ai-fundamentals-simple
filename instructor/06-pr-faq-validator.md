# PR-FAQ Validator Project - Instructor Guide

## Session Overview
This guide walks through enhancing and extending the PR-FAQ Validator project, combining concepts from previous sessions into a practical enterprise tool.

## Prerequisites
- Completed all previous sessions
- Understanding of document analysis
- Experience with MCP and RAG
- Basic knowledge of CI/CD

## Learning Path

### 1. PR-FAQ Analysis (1 hour)

#### Key Concepts
- Document structure analysis
- Content validation rules
- Feedback generation
- Integration patterns

#### Core Components
1. Document Parser
2. Validation Engine
3. Feedback Generator
4. Integration API

### 2. Enhancement Implementation (2 hours)

#### Core Features
1. Smart Validation
```python
# Code samples will be in the notebook
# We'll implement:
# 1. Context-aware validation
# 2. Pattern recognition
# 3. Suggestion generation
```

2. RAG Integration
```python
# Including:
# 1. Similar document search
# 2. Best practices matching
# 3. Example recommendation
```

3. MCP-Based Processing
```python
# Covering:
# 1. State management
# 2. Context handling
# 3. Progressive validation
```

#### Common Challenges & Solutions
