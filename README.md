### Code Quality Tools

This project uses the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **flake8**: Python linting with multiple plugins
  - flake8-docstrings: Docstring style checking
  - flake8-bugbear: Additional bug and design problem checks
  - flake8-comprehensions: Comprehension improvements
  - flake8-simplify: Code simplification suggestions

make lint

# Format code
make format
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically run on every commit to ensure code quality:

- Trailing whitespace removal
- End-of-file fixing
- YAML/JSON validation
- Large file detection
- Merge conflict detection
- Python linting (flake8)
- Import sorting (isort)
- Code formatting (black)

To run pre-commit hooks manually on all files:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
# or
make pre-commit-run
```
